## 1 Connected Graph
### Description
An undirected graph is a set V of vertices and a set of E∈{V*V} edges.An undirected graph is connected if and only if for every pair (u,v) of vertices,u is reachable from v. 
You are to write a program that tries to calculate the number of different connected undirected graph with n vertices. 
For example,there are 4 different connected undirected graphs with 3 vertices. 

### Input
The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the number of vertices. You may assume that 1<=n<=50. The last test case is followed by one zero.
### Output

For each test case output the answer on a single line.
